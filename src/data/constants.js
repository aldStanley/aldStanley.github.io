      "I'm a software engineer passionate about solving real-world problems and building impactful systems. With a strong interest in AI, I enjoy creating intelligent tools that make a difference. Recently, I contributed to the development of GeoFlow, a geo-AI agent achieving state-of-the-art performance—our short paper was recently submitted to the 33rd ACM SIGSPATIAL and is currently under review. (Details below.) I'm always open to opportunities to collaborate on meaningful, forward-looking tech projects!",
